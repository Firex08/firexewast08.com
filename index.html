Electronic waste, popularly known as e-waste can be defined as electronic equipment's/products connects with power plug, batteries which have become obsolete due to: advancement in technology changes in fashion, style and status nearing the end of their useful life.E-waste encompasses ever growing range of obsolete electronic devices such as computers, servers, main frames, monitors, TVs & display devices, telecommunication devices such as cellular phones & pagers, calculators, audio and video devices, printers, scanners, copiers and fax machines besides refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines, and microwave ovens, e-waste also covers recording devices such as DVDs, CDs, floppies, tapes, printing cartridges, military electronic waste, automobile catalytic converters, electronic components such as chips, processors, mother boards, printed circuit boards, industrial electronics such as sensors, alarms, sirens, security devices, automobile electronic device.<BR><BR><img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1032912050/photo/e-waste-heap-from-discarded-laptop-parts.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=0GhFIqXKK1bRzdyMugLkB5Dj7spnwmhgVhRJEwBgoO8="> </img><br><br><br><br>

E-waste, electronic waste, e-scrap and end-of-life electronics are terms often used to describe used electronics that are nearing the end of their useful life, and are discarded, donated or given to a recycler. The UN defines e-waste as any discarded products with a battery or plug, and features toxic and hazardous substances such as mercury, that can pose severe risk to human and environmental health.<br><br><br>
<b><i><font size=5>The Negative Effects on Air</font></b></i><br>
<p>Contamination in the air occurs when e-waste is informally disposed by dismantling, shredding or melting the materials, releasing dust particles or toxins, such as dioxins, into the environment that cause air pollution and damage respiratory health. E-waste of little value is often burned, but burning also serves a way to get valuable metal from electronics, like copper. Chronic diseases and cancers are at a higher risk to occur when burning e-waste because it also releases fine particles, which can travel thousands of miles, creating numerous negative health risks to humans and animals. Higher value materials, such as gold and silver, are often removed from highly integrated electronics by using acids, desoldering, and other chemicals, which also release fumes in areas where recycling is not regulated properly. The negative effects on air from informal e-waste recycling are most dangerous for those who handle this waste, but the pollution can extend thousands of miles away from recycling sites<br>
The air pollution caused by e-waste impacts some animal species more than others, which may be endangering these species and the biodiversity of certain regions that are chronically polluted. Over time, air pollution can hurt water quality, soil and plant species, creating irreversible damage in ecosystems. For instance, an informal recycling hub in Guiyu, China that was formed by parties interesting in extracting valuable metals from e-waste, and subsequently has caused the region to have extremely high lead levels in the air, which are inhaled and then ingested when returned to water and soil. This can cause disproportionate neurological damage to larger animals, wildlife and humans in the area.</p><br><BR><BR>
<b><i><font size=5>The Negative Effects on Water</font></b></i><br>
After soil contamination, heavy metals from e-waste, such as mercury, lithium, lead and barium, then leak through the earth even further to reach groundwater. When these heavy metals reach groundwater, they eventually make their way into ponds, streams, rivers and lakes. Through these pathways, acidification and toxification are created in the water, which is unsafe for animals, plants and communities even if they are miles away from a recycling site. Clean drinking water becomes problematic to find.<BR><BR>
Acidification can kill marine and freshwater organisms, disturb biodiversity and harm ecosystems. If acidification is present in water supplies, it can damage ecosystems to the point where recovery is questionable, if not impossible.
<BR><BR><b><i><font size=5>How to control E-Wast</font></b></i><br><BR><BR>
-Re-evaluate. Do you really need that extra gadget? Try finding one device with multiple functions.<BR><BR>
-Extend the life of your electronics. Buy a case, keep your device clean, and avoid overcharging the battery. <BR><BR>
-Buy environmentally friendly electronics. Look for products labeled Energy Star or certified by the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT).<BR><BR>
-Donate used electronics to social programs—and help victims of domestic violence, children safety initiatives, environmental causes, and more. Ask your student REP for a postage paid mailer for your cell phone or ink cartridge. For each item received, the World Wildlife Fund will receive one dollar.<BR><BR>
-Recycle electronics and batteries in e-waste recycling bins located around campus.  Large electronics can go in the larger bins found in your building.<BR><BR>
